      'The new RUUT X is our most racy gravel bike in the collection. With product specs inspired by amateur cyclocross racing and fast gravel rides. This bike is built for CX racing on a muddy Sunday or a quick training session around your local trails. The RUUT X features lightweight components with a carbon aero handlebar and carbon seatpost, a 11-36 cassette with enough range and narrower spacing than typical 10-42t, and fast and light 35mm tyres on HUNT aero wheels. This version of RUUT has everything that CX riders need, with the option to add bigger gravel tyres up to 45c for the ultimate off-road speed machine.',
